			<h2>About Us</h2>
			<p>
				The Wildfire Games team is an assembly of individuals with a wide variance of locations, experience, skills, and personalities. Together, as a team, we have united to partake in an experience that very few have successfully completed.
				<br>
				WFG started out as a modding team for Ensemble Studiosâ€™ Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings. In fact, this very project was initialised with the conception of it being a mod for Age of Kings (July 2001). The limitations of modding encouraged us to expand our skills to game development and we began to make the transition in early 2002. Throughout 2002 and 2003, much of the development time was spent learning things the 'hard way' in design, code architecture, artistic methods, etc. It was only by the summer of 2003 that our hard work was beginning to pay off. From here on out, we have been working at full steam ahead to complete the project.
